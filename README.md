# SublimeGameOfLife
A Sublime Text package which simulates Conway's Game of Life through your Sublime Text file's contents!

## Usage
Use the keystroke `ctrl-alt-g` to start the game of life. Hitting the keystroke once again will revert your file to its original state.

## Disclaimer
**You should always keep a backup of your files, especially the ones undergoing the game of life!** I, although potentially sad, am not responsible if your files are messed up by this. 

Also, very large files, understandably, take a while to process, so avoid running the game of life on things such as the Linux kernel.

## Installation
Game of Life isn't on package control... yet. In the meantime, follow [these](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/packages.html) instructions to install the package!

### Have fun!
