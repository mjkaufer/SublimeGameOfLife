# SublimeGameOfLife
A game of life simulator, using a sublime file's contents.

## Usage
Use the keystroke `ctrl-alt-g` to start the game of life. Hitting the keystroke once again will revert your file to its original state.

## Disclaimer
**You should always keep a backup of your files, especially the ones undergoing the game of life!** I, although potentially sad, am not responsible if your files are messed up by this.
